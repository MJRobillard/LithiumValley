Geothermal Data Repository,Lithium,https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1306#:~:text=These%20files%20contain%20the%20geodatabases outputs%20for%20the%20Salton%20Sea,These files contain the geodatabases related to Salton Sea Geothermal Field. It includes all input and output files used with the Geothermal Exploration Artificial Intelligence. Input and output files are sorted into three categories: raw data  pre-processed data  and analysis (post-processed data). In each of these categories there are six additional types of raster catalogs which are titled Radar  SWIR  Thermal  Geophysics  Geology  and Wells. The files are used with the Geothermal Exploration Artificial Intelligence for the Salton Sea Geothermal Site to identify indicators of blind geothermal systems. The included zip file is a geodatabase to be used with ArcGIS and the tar file is an inclusive database that encompasses the inputs and outputs for the Salton Sea Geothermal Site.,X Y OBJECTID WellStatus WellType WellSymbol GISSource APINumber GeoDistrict District Confidential ReleaseDate CountyAPICode CountyName LeaseName WellNumber OperatorCode OperatorName OperatorStatus FieldCode FieldName AreaCode AreaName TownshipSection Township Range BaseMeridian Directional Redrill SpudDate ABDdate CompDate Lat83 Long83 DatumCode WellStatusDescription WellDesignation
