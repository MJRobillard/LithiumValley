GeoFlight, subsurface, https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6686d5cfd34ebb7843398b10, The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have collaborated to acquire high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric data over the Salton Trough in southern California to support geologic and geophysical mapping and modeling that will assist geothermal and critical mineral studies. The surveys referred to as GeoFlight spans an area that contains some of the largest and hottest known hydrothermal systems in the world as well as a substantial lithium brine resource that could potentially meet the nationâ€™s lithium demand for electric vehicles., Mag radar diurnal elevation diurnal corrected mag, , The raw data was literally 5 readings a second. Had to bin the data by lon lat at an arbitrary granularity that had a high definition while less then 10% null values. More information in the ipynb

It includes all input and output files used with the Geothermal Exploration Artificial Intelligence. Input and output files are sorted into three categories: raw data  pre-processed data  and analysis (post-processed data). In each of these categories there are six additional types of raster catalogs which are titled Radar  SWIR  Thermal  Geophysics  Geology  and Wells. The files are used with the Geothermal Exploration Artificial Intelligence for the Salton Sea Geothermal Site to identify indicators of blind geothermal systems. The included zip file is a geodatabase to be used with ArcGIS and the tar file is an inclusive database that encompasses the inputs and outputs for the Salton Sea Geothermal Site.,,, Insanely hard to work with. The bulk of the data is within the thermal and radar folders. The Analysis folder is merely a narrative of the risk and some of the minerals there which may be useful but it's so hard to work with.

Geothermal Data Repository (GDR), surface, https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/194, GEOTHERM is a comprehensive system of public databases and software used to store locate and evaluate information on the geology geochemistry and hydrology of geothermal systems. Three main databases address the general characteristics of geothermal wells and fields and the chemical properties of geothermal fluids; the last database is currently the most active. System tasks are divided into four areas: 1. data acquisition and entry involving data entry via word processors and magnetic tape; 2. quality assurance including the criteria and standards handbook and front-end data-screening programs; 3. operation involving database backups and information extraction; and 4. user assistance preparation of such items as application programs and a quarterly newsletter.,GRECORD_	NAME	KGRA	WELLSPRING	API	WARINGNO	COUNTRY	STATE	COUNTY	LATITUDE	LONGITUDE	T	R	SEC	QSECTIONS	BMERIDIAN	MREFERENCE	GEOPROVINC	LOCALITYIN	SOURCETYPE	PCOLLECT	SAMPLENUM	CDATE	COLLECTOR	BLANK	DEPOSITS	TREATMENT	LITHOLOGY	SAMPLEINFO	SAMPLEINFA	ADATE	ANALYST	UNITS	AMEAS	TEMP	DTEMP	FLOW	AMTEMP	DEPTH	GRADIENT	WHPRESSURE	PRESSURE1	PRESSURE2	PRESSURE3	STEAMFLOW	TFLOWENTH	PH	PHTEMP	GRAVITY	CONDUCTANC	ALKALINITY	TDS	TSS	AG	AL	AS	AU	B	BA	BE	BI	BR	CA	CAMG	CD	CL	CO	CO3	CR	CS	CU	F	FE3	FETOTAL	GA	GE	HCO3	HG	H2S	I	K	LI	MG	MN	MO	NA	NAK	NB	NH4	NI	NO3	PB	PO4	RB	S	SB	SC	SE	SIO2	SN	SO4	SR	TA	TI	U	V	W	ZN	DWATER	OWATER18	OSO418	SH2S34	SH2S34REV	C13CO2	TRITIUM	C14OFC02	OTHERADATA	QUALIFINFO	REFERENCE	RORGANIZAT,data\GEOTHERM\GEOTHERM_ALL(GEO_ALL).csv, In progress seems straight forward to filter it for lithium valley / imperial county
USGS Geochemical and mineralogical maps with interpretations for soils, Lithium, Between 2007 and 2013 the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a low-density (1 site per 1600 square kilometers 4857 sites) geochemical and mineralogical survey of soils in the conterminous United States. The sampling protocol for the national-scale survey included at each site a sample from a depth of 0 to 5 centimeters a composite of the soil A horizon and a deeper sample from the soil C horizon or if the top of the C horizon was at a depth greater than 1 meter a sample from a depth of approximately 80â€“100 centimeters. The <2-millimeter fraction of each sample was analyzed for a suite of 45 major and trace elements by methods that yield the total or near-total elemental concentration. The major mineralogical components in the samples from the soil A and C horizons were determined by a quantitative X-ray diffraction method using Rietveld refinement.,,, data\USGS_Gochemical_Mineralogical_Map\Li.kmz, will need to convert to a shape file or attribtues for the main shape file bassically the same of the magnetic anomolies
