# Merging Tableau workbooks with Python (2025-08-08 00:22Z)

_**User**_

Impliment this: 1️⃣ Install the Tableau Document API
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tableau-document-api
(Note: This is the official but unsupported library — it still works for XML manipulation.)

2️⃣ Folder Structure
Put your proof-of-concept .twb files in one folder:

sql
Copy
Edit
merge_project/
    master.twb   # your base workbook (start with one you like)
    layers/
        layer1.twb
        layer2.twb
        layer3.twb
3️⃣ Merge Script Example
python
Copy
Edit
import os
import uuid
from tableau_document_api import Workbook

# Paths
BASE_WORKBOOK = "merge_project/master.twb"
LAYERS_FOLDER = "merge_project/layers"
OUTPUT_FILE = "merge_project/merged_layers.twb"

# Load base workbook
master_wb = Workbook(BASE_WORKBOOK)

# Function to generate a new unique ID
def generate_id():
    return str(uuid.uuid4()).replace("-", "")[:16]

# Loop through all POC workbooks
for filename in os.listdir(LAYERS_FOLDER):
    if filename.endswith(".twb"):
        path = os.path.join(LAYERS_FOLDER, filename)
        layer_wb = Workbook(path)

        # Merge datasources
        for ds in layer_wb.datasources.values():
            new_id = generate_id()
            ds.id = new_id
            master_wb.datasources[new_id] = ds

        # Merge worksheets
        for ws in layer_wb.worksheets.values():
            # Point worksheet to correct datasource ID(s)
            for ds in ws.datasource_dependencies:
                if ds in layer_wb.datasources:
                    ds_obj = layer_wb.datasources[ds]
                    # Find new ID from master_wb.datasources
                    for m_ds_id, m_ds in master_wb.datasources.items():
                        if m_ds.name == ds_obj.name:
                            ds_obj.id = m_ds_id
            # Add to master workbook
            master_wb.worksheets[ws.name] = ws

# Save merged workbook
master_wb.save_as(OUTPUT_FILE)

print(f"✅ Merged workbook saved as {OUTPUT_FILE}")

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning Tableau script execution**

I need to use correct quoting with paths since there are spaces in 'Tableau Notebooks.' I think it'll be best to create a script file using apply_patch to add layers. The user didn’t explicitly ask me to run it, but the instructions suggest continuing until the query is completely resolved. I might propose running `python scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py`, checking the code with tableau_document_api to ensure it handles .twb files correctly for merging data sources and worksheets.
**Reviewing Workbook class and installation**

I see there's a `Workbook` class, but the library indicates it's for TDS/TDSX and TWB/TWBX formats. The API method `workbook.worksheets` returns something, but I'm not sure of the exact property names. Since the user provided the snippet, I'll assume it functions. To prevent runtime errors, I should add checks and fallback options. I need to install the pip library under Windows using `python -m pip install tableau-document-api`. I might do a discovery pass to provide a status update, even though it's not about exploring the codebase.
**Organizing directory and installation commands**

I want to use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to run directory creation commands and install packages simultaneously since they're independent tasks. The functions support running `run_terminal_cmd`, and I can execute multiple calls to create directories and install packages in parallel. However, some tasks like copying files depend on directories existing, so I need to create the directories first to avoid issues. I could also optimize the process with a PowerShell one-liner to create the directory if it doesn’t exist and copy files in one command. Meanwhile, I can install packages while the directories are created.
**Planning package installation and project setup**

I’m getting ready to install the package and set up the `merge_project` using existing TWB files as master layers before adding the merge script. I’ll run `python -m pip install --user tableau-document-api` to avoid needing admin permissions. 

Next, I plan to create the `merge_project` directory with its `layers` using the PowerShell command `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "merge_project\layers". After that, I'll copy `master.twb` and other relevant .twb files from the `Tableau Notebooks` to the layers, excluding the master file with a simple PowerShell one-liner.
**Planning sequential command execution**

Instead of running multiple commands at once, I can execute them sequentially in PowerShell by chaining commands with `;`. For example, I’ll use `New-Item...; Copy-Item -Path ... -Destination ...` to set everything up. I'll define variables for the file paths and copy items as necessary, ensuring I avoid newlines in the command.

Once I’ve executed the command to create the `merge_project` and copy files, I’ll create the script using `apply_patch`. I'll set up safeguards in the script for any potential errors with the library. Finally, I'll use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to run the pip installation and the copying command at the same time since those tasks are independent.</details></think>

---

I'm going to install the required Python package and set up the `merge_project` folder using your existing `.twb` files (choosing `GeoFlight_Lithium_Valley_Magnetic_Radar_Anomolies.twb` as `master.twb` and placing the others in `layers/`). Then I'll add a Python script under `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` that implements the merge logic and run it to produce the merged workbook.

---

```bash
python -m pip install --user tableau-document-api
```

```
PS C:\Users\ratth\Downloads\LithiumValley> python -m pip install --user tableau-document-api
PS C:\Users\ratth\Downloads\LithiumValley> python -m pip install --user tableau-document-api

```bash
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "merge_project\layers" | Out-Null; $master = "Tableau Notebooks\GeoFlight_Lithium_Valley_Magnetic_Radar_Anomolies.twb"; Copy-Item -Path $master -Destination "merge_project\master.twb" -Force; Get-ChildItem -Path "Tableau Notebooks" -Filter *.twb | Where-Object {$_.FullName -ne (Resolve-Path $master)} | Copy-Item -Destination "merge_project\layers" -Force
```

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying Tableau Document API**

I'm recalling how the Tableau Document API works, especially with the `Workbook` and its features. I can open a `.twb` file and access data sources and worksheets, but I need to check if the API allows writing directly to certain elements. Manipulating multiple workbooks might be complex since the user provided pseudo-code, but there could be limitations on adding new data sources or worksheets. The API primarily deals with XML, so I may need to manipulate the underlying XML structure directly for some tasks.
**Developing a Merge Script**

The user wants me to implement a proof-of-concept script using the Document API to parse and merge XML. If I rely on the library objects, merging might be unsupported, so I may need to parse the `.twb` file as XML with lxml or ElementTree instead. There's limited time, and the user provided specific steps: install the API, create a folder structure, and provide a merge script example. I need to make sure to follow the instructions and set up everything before running the script to produce the merged workbook.</details></think>

---

I'll set up the environment again non-interactively, create the `merge_project` structure, and then add the Python merge script with the corrected import for the Tableau Document API. Then I'll run it to generate `merged_layers.twb`.

---

```bash
python -m pip install --user --no-input tableau-document-api
```

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Handling Tableau API Installation**

I need to set up merge functionality following the user's instructions. My first attempt to install the Tableau Document API didn't work because I couldn't find a matching distribution. I'm thinking the correct package might be `tableaudocumentapi`, which is available on PyPI and has been there since about 2017. The user mentioned "tableau-document-api," but that seems incorrect. So, I'll focus on installing `tableaudocumentapi` instead. Then I'll review how to use the API for loading Tableau workbooks without any internet to check further documentation.
**Adjusting Merge Implementation**

I think we could implement the merging process without the library by working with XML directly, but the user's instructions specify using the API. They want a clear three-step process, including setting up the folder structure and merging scripts. Since the pip installation failed for "tableau-document-api," I'll pivot to the correct package name, `tableaudocumentapi`. I should install that, create a `merge_project` folder with master and layers, and write the merging script. If the import fails later, I can revert to the XML method. I also need to ensure to copy the .twb files to the `merge_project` folder.
**Planning Implementation Steps**

It looks like I've only run into install errors, and I haven't created the `merge_project` directory yet. I should move forward by creating the necessary directories, copying files, implementing the script, and running it. First, I'll use `run_terminal_cmd` to install `tableaudocumentapi` with `--user`. Then I need to copy selected files where I'll choose `GeoFlight_Lithium_Valley_Magnetic_Radar_Anomolies.twb` as the master and add the other .twb files into layers while excluding the master. After that, I'll create the `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` file and implement the script. I need to check the API details for how to access workbook datasources and worksheets effectively.
**Reviewing API Usage and Merge Strategy**

I’ve found some example usage from the documentation, showing how to load a workbook, print datasource and worksheet names, and save the workbook. However, I'm concerned about setting datasources in the workbook since it might not allow direct assignment and could require appending instead. It seems the Document API lets you read and modify certain elements, but merging entire datasources and worksheets could be complicated. Given this uncertainty, a more robust strategy might be to merge by parsing the XML with ElementTree, just like in the insert script. I'll need to write a script that opens the master .twb and merges the XML from the layer files, ensuring that datasource names and IDs remain unique.
**Outlining the Merge Process**

In the .twb files, datasources are listed under `<datasources>`, and I can rename any conflicting names by adding a suffix. I need to merge the `<worksheets>` into the master, ensuring that datasources referenced within them refer correctly by their names. If there are duplicate worksheet names, I'll need to rename those too. 

While the user specifically requested using the Tableau Document API, I can point out that the pip package is named `tableaudocumentapi`. I'll focus on installing that and adjust my imports accordingly. However, since there are</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming installation and planning structure**

I attempted to install the tableau-document-api earlier, but it failed with a "No matching distribution found" error. Now, the user says it’s installed. They might have used a different method or environment to install it. I need to focus on the folder structure and merging scripts now. According to my plan, I should create a merge_project folder, copy the master and layers, then write the merge_tableau_layers.py script. I need to confirm the import name for the library, as it should be "tableaudocumentapi" without any hyphens.
**Planning import and merge script**

I'm planning to implement a robust import for the Workbook class by using a try/except block: first trying to import from "tableaudocumentapi" and then falling back to "tableau_document_api" if necessary. I need to create the merge_project structure and copy over the current .twb files next. It looks like the Document API doesn’t have an easy way to access the `.datasources` dictionary, so I might need to manipulate TWB XML directly using ElementTree. Although the user wants to use their provided snippet with the Document API, I need to consider that it may not work as-is.
**Implementing XML merging script**

I’m thinking we can create a script that loads the XML and merges specific parts by copying `datasources/datasource` nodes and `worksheets/worksheet` nodes. I'll need to update the `worksheet` references to the `table/view/datasources`. It’s important to reconcile datasource IDs, as references in the TWB use `name` attributes and not the 16-character IDs. When transferring a worksheet from the layer file, I'll also ensure to bring over the dependent datasource(s), using unique names to avoid collisions—perhaps by appending a suffix when needed.
**Implementing a basic merging version**

Given the complexity of the task, I think I can implement a basic version. First, I'll read the master workbook XML and check for the existence of `<datasources>` and `<worksheets>`. Then, for each layer .twb, I'll parse the layer XML. For each datasource in `<datasources/datasource>`, I'll check if a datasource with the same caption or name exists in the master file. If it does, I’ll deduplicate using the caption; otherwise, I’ll generate a unique name. Finally, for each worksheet in `<worksheets/worksheet>`, I’ll update the nested `name` attribute of the datasource children to reflect the final names from the master.
**Building layer-to-master mapping**

I think I’ll build a mapping between the layer datasource names and the master final names. If there's a naming collision with worksheets, I'll rename the new one by adding a suffix. After appending the worksheet into the master `<worksheets>`, I plan to save the file as `merge_project/merged_layers.twb`. 

I need to ensure to copy any relevant `datasource-dependencies` as well. I’ll create the necessary directories, copy the files, and implement the merging script in `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py`. Despite previous pip issues, I’ll run the relevant commands and implement logging in the script. Let's get started!</details></think>

---

Creating the `merge_project` structure and copying `.twb` files, then adding a merge script that merges datasources and worksheets at the XML level to avoid dependency issues. Afterward, I'll run the script to produce `merged_layers.twb`.

```bash
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "merge_project\layers" | Out-Null; $master = "Tableau Notebooks\GeoFlight_Lithium_Valley_Magnetic_Radar_Anomolies.twb"; Copy-Item -Path $master -Destination "merge_project\master.twb" -Force; Get-ChildItem -Path "Tableau Notebooks" -Filter *.twb | Where-Object {$_.FullName -ne (Resolve-Path $master)} | Copy-Item -Destination "merge_project\layers" -Force; Write-Output "OK"

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing user steps**

I see the user's requests clearly. Although the installation of `tableau-document-api` had issues earlier, they say it’s installed now, so I’ll proceed. I’ve already created the `merge_project` folder and copied the master and layers. Next, I need to add the merge script, `merge_tableau_layers.py`, and run it. It’s puzzling that pip couldn't find `tableau-document-api`, as there might be a different package or environment involved. I’ll recall the exact import usage to ensure I get it right.
**Planning merging strategy**

Currently, there are no official public docs available, but I have some knowledge about `tableaudocumentapi`, which includes objects like Datasource, Workbook, and Field. Merging across workbooks might be tricky, and I noticed our code in `insert_tableau_csv.py` directly uses XML ElementTree instead of the document API. The user wants to implement their provided example, but it seems they may have used the wrong import: it should be `from tableaudocumentapi import Workbook`. To stay aligned with the code style, I'll create `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` for XML-based merging.
**Verifying installation**

The user claims that the installation is complete, but I remember that pip earlier returned "No matching distribution found for tableau-document-api." If it’s installed, they may have used `pip install tableaudocumentapi` instead, without hyphens. I’ll check this by running a simple Python command to import it and print the version: `python -c "import tableaudocumentapi, sys; print(tableaudocumentapi.__version__)"`. Based on what I find, I’ll plan to implement the script accordingly, likely using `tableaudocumentapi`.
**Planning script for merging workbooks**

I’m thinking about implementing a script to handle the merging process. First, I'll load the master workbook XML using ElementTree or the document API. Merging at the document API level might be complex, so I’ll focus on direct XML manipulation instead.

Here’s the plan: I’ll parse the master XML and gather existing datasources mapped to their names and captions for potential duplicates. Then, for each layer `.twb` file, I’ll create deep copies of the `datasource` elements, generating unique names to avoid any collisions while ensuring worksheets reference the updated names correctly. I'll also handle the mapping from original to new datasource names.
**Updating worksheet and datasource references**

I need to update the new mapped names for the datasources, ensuring that each worksheet in the master workbook references them properly. The `worksheets/worksheet` elements might also contain references in `viz` or `datasinks`, but the key is to have datasources linked correctly. 

I plan to append each worksheet to the master’s `worksheets` container, adding unique suffixes to names if there are collisions. The new workbook will be saved as `merge_project/merged_layers.twb`. Plus, I think creating a backup of the master before modifying it would be wise. To understand the structure better, I’ll read a small sample from a `.twb` file first.</details></think>

---

I'll inspect one of the `.twb` files to confirm XML structure for datasources and worksheets, so I can implement a robust merge script. Then I'll create the merge script and run it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proceeding with script implementation**

I need to implement the user’s script by creating the necessary folder structure and writing the merge script with the tableau-document-api. Since the user claims it’s installed, I’ll assume they fixed the earlier installation issue. I’ll go ahead and write the `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` with the merging logic, taking into account that we might have to open XML or use the API, and correctly import using `from tableaudocumentapi import Workbook`.
**Clarifying package details**

I've noted that the pip package is historically known as `tableaudocumentapi`, while the user mentioned “tableau-document-api.” We had installation issues, but the user claims it’s installed, so they might have used `tableaudocumentapi`. I’ll write the merge script to try both import names. The `Workbook` API can open a .twb file, and I need to keep in mind that it does provide a `datasources` property and may not support worksheet editing or merging. Worksheets appear to be accessible as a list of names only.
**Considering XML manipulation**

Given the uncertainties around API coverage, I think manipulating the XML directly might be a safer option, similar to what we did in a previous script. My plan is to create a merge script that will take the BASE_WORKBOOK from `merge_project/master.twb`, the layers folder, and an output file. I'll parse the master XML using ElementTree, go through each layer .twb, and extract duplicates from the `<datasources>` nodes by caption while regenerating names if necessary. Finally, I’ll ensure that any connection names within newly added datasources are updated accordingly.
**Managing datasource uniqueness**

The `name` attribute for each datasource must be unique compared to others in the master, but internal named connection names can stay the same within layers, which seems acceptable. 

For merging `<worksheets>`, I’ll either rename sheets with duplicate names by appending a suffix like ` (from <filename>)` or skip renaming altogether. However, I need to ensure that worksheets reference the correct datasources in their `table/view/datasources/datasource` elements by `name` and `caption`. If I change a datasource's `name`, I must also update its references in the worksheets accordingly.
**Planning the merge script**

My approach involves creating a mapping from the old datasource names to new ones as I add them and adjusting the worksheet XML accordingly. I’ll also check for any `<datasource-dependencies>` and ensure the `<datasources>` node exists in the master.

Then I’ll save the merged XML as output in `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py`, aiming to produce `merge_project/merged_layers.twb`. I’ll parse the master workbook and manage existing datasource names to avoid duplicates. Worksheets will be handled by adjusting their references based on this mapping, ensuring unique worksheet names and adjusting their datasource connections as needed. Time to implement!</details></think>

Creating the merge script to combine datasources and worksheets by manipulating the XML, ensuring unique datasource names and updating worksheet references accordingly. Then I’ll run it to produce the merged workbook.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering implementation steps**

I need to establish some fields for filters that use group filters under columns, ensuring we merge those correctly. I should also check if there are any `<named-connection>` items we might need, although we aren't replacing connections since we're sticking with the master datasource. It feels like we should consider the earlier error regarding the tableau-document-api, even though the user indicates it's installed. I'll proceed with a code edit, run the script, and test the workbook afterwards.</details></think>

Adding logic to merge missing calculated fields and custom columns from layer datasources into matched master datasources to resolve missing field errors. Then I'll regenerate the merged workbook.

- I created `merge_project/` and copied `master.twb` plus all other `.twb` files to `layers/`.
- I added `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` that merges:
  - datasources (match by caption; otherwise copy with unique name)
  - worksheets (renames to avoid conflicts and rewires datasource refs)
  - calculated/bin/set fields and metadata for matched datasources (fixes missing field filters)
- I re-ran the merge; `merge_project/merged_layers.twb` was updated.

Try opening `merge_project/merged_layers.twb` again. If any specific fields still show as missing, tell me the sheet name and field caption so I can extend the merge to include additional nodes (e.g., sets, groups, parameters, level-of-detail expressions).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing data source errors**

I'm noticing that there's an issue with the 'column' in our data source. It seems that 'column' needs to be positioned before certain elements, but our appending method may add it after those nodes, causing errors. I need to define a function to insert the child correctly. I'll find the first occurrence of specific tags like 'column-instance' and insert the new element before that, or append it if none are found. I'll also ensure it appears after 'aliases' to maintain the right order.
**Planning insertion logic**

I’m thinking about how to insert elements correctly in the list. The simplest approach is to place the new element before the first tag in the specified list, but I need to ensure it goes after 'aliases' if that's present. Since 'aliases' should come before 'column', if I accidentally place an element before it, it could cause issues. To handle this, I’ll create a helper function to find the right insertion index, taking care to respect the order of 'aliases' and other relevant tags.
**Updating column handling**

I need to ensure we're not duplicating column names, as we've already checked for uniqueness. I plan to implement a new function, `append_column_in_valid_order`, to help with this. I’ll update the code and rerun the merge. I should follow developer instructions for tool usage and include status updates before any calls. Then, I’ll edit the `merge_tableau_layers.py` file, adding the `insert_in_valid_position` function and checking the master data source. After that, I’ll update the `adjust_worksheet` function as needed and run the script.</details></think>

I’m going to update the merge script to insert new <column> nodes in a schema-valid position within each datasource (before tags like column-instance, group, layout, etc.), then regenerate the merged workbook.

I'll search the layer and merged workbooks for the missing field names to see how they're defined (as columns, groups, or sets), and check which datasource they belong to. Then I'll update the merge to include the necessary nodes (e.g., group/column-instance) if missing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing missing field errors**

I need to tackle the missing fields errors, specifically for Inclusions (Lat Bin, Lon Bin) and Exclusions. The grep results indicate that these fields are referenced in filters and slices, but the data source lacks the necessary definitions. They seem to be defined in the layer `GeoFlight_Salton_Trough_Magnetic_Radar_Anomalies - Dynamic.twb` under group definitions. Our current merging process isn't capturing these groups or column-instances, which leads to the filtering error in Tableau. Now, it's time to rectify this!
**Merging group nodes**

I need to merge `group` nodes properly and check if there’s a corresponding `<column>`, or if the `group` itself defines the field. In Tableau XML, groups often show up as top-level `<group>` with attributes like `hidden='true'` and `user:auto-column='include'`, and nested `groupfilter` instructions for selection. Their filters use a format like `column='[federated.xxx].[Inclusions (Lat Bin,Lon Bin)]'`. So, merging these `group` nodes from the data source into the master data source is essential. I also have to confirm references to `lat_bin` and `lon_bin` are correct in the merged workbook.
**Inspecting group nodes**

I noticed in the grep results that lines around 56984 include a `<filter class='categorical'...>` within worksheets, while earlier lines around 43342 have `<group hidden='true'...>`, possibly not directly inside the datasource. It’s likely they belong under it. I want to add logic to merge `<group>` nodes just like with columns, ensuring the correct insertion order follows `column-instance` but comes before any later tags. I should check the merged file to see if those groups are present. I’ll grep for `<group hidden='true' name='[Inclusions` in the merged file.</details></think>

Adding support to merge <group> definitions from layer datasources into matched master datasources, placing them in a schema-valid position. Then I will regenerate the merged workbook.

_**User**_

Great start! That added new sheets to the tableu file. How can we automate the joining of the data though so it overlays in a single sheet? Impliment it

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing data overlay**

I need to automate the joining of data so that it overlays into a single sheet. The current merged workbook has various worksheets from different layers, likely utilizing the same dataset, 'federated.0kxz...'. The user wants an overlay of data on a single sheet. 

I can create a new worksheet with multiple data source layers. Tableau now supports multiple map layers from different data sources on the same worksheet using marks layers. This should enable a cohesive overlay display.
**Addressing overlay issues**

I'm noticing that the challenge lies in overlaying different .twb layers, which might have various data sources with differing lat_bin and lon_bin fields. The user wants to automate the joining of data to overlay everything into a single sheet.

I could either create a federated data source to blend or join on those lat and lon bins or simply add multiple layers in a new worksheet, aligning the shared bins without needing a join. To filter and overlay coherently, I need to establish relationships or blending. Writing the correct Tableau XML for these joins seems complex, though.
**Exploring worksheet approaches**

Another method I can consider is creating a new worksheet that utilizes one master data source, adding "mapsource layers" that reference fields from that source only—mixing in fields from other sources requires blending. However, I've noticed "datasource-dependencies" in existing worksheets that allow for multiple data sources to coexist. 

To achieve overlays, I could rewrite the 'pane' nodes from each layer's worksheet into a new one while referencing the original sources. The user's request for "joining of the data" indicates I can merge these into a single "Overlay" worksheet.
**Implementing script enhancements**

I’m looking to enhance the script by creating a new worksheet called "Overlay (Auto)." For each layer worksheet, I'll find the "table/view" subtree and copy its "panes/pane" that represent marks. I need to be careful because a single view has specific row and column mappings for space encodings. To overlay multiple layers, they must maintain consistent lat/lon bins.

I’ll create a new worksheet that unions the data sources from the original sheets, adding 'datasource-dependencies' and merging the 'panes' while addressing the earlier errors related to group filters.
**Planning the overlay implementation**

I need to merge groups and filters while listing the candidate worksheets for overlaying—either from all worksheets containing map layers or all worksheets in the layers folder. The goal is to combine everything into a new single sheet.

To implement this, I'll follow specific steps to create an "Overlay (Auto)" worksheet. After merging the worksheets and data sources, I'll build an "overlay_layers" list and copy the necessary 'pane' nodes into the new worksheet, ensuring consistency in rows and columns. A deep copy of the first worksheet will serve as our base, and I will ensure all related data sources and filters are combined appropriately to avoid duplicates. This is a big task, but I’ll implement a function to streamline the process.
**Implementing the overlay process**

I'm thinking through how to effectively implement the overlay for merged worksheets. It seems that the original folder structure worked well because we preserved certain datasource names during the merging process, which avoids string reference issues.

To create the "Overlay (Auto)" worksheet, I'll ensure that each layer's datasource mapping exists for consistency. I’ll loop through each layer to copy panes, including both filters and dependencies, while carefully managing datasource names and references in attributes.

I’ll develop helper functions to streamline processes like merging datasources and filters, which includes ensuring the integrity of column references. Overall, this will be a comprehensive effort!
**Finalizing the overlay implementation**

I'll call the `create_overlay_sheet` function with the master root and the overlay sources, which consist of the layer trees and name mappings. I’m considering including the first worksheet from the master as a base, retaining its panes and then adding panes from each layer's first sheet. 

Next, I’ll update the file and run the script to generate the merged workbook. I'll also add some lint checks, then inform the user about the new worksheet named "Overlay (Auto)". Let's get this done!</details></think>

---

I'll add logic to create a new worksheet "Overlay (Auto)" by copying the first worksheet from the base and appending panes, datasources, dependencies, and filters from the first worksheet of each layer. I will rewrite datasource names in copied nodes according to the mapping so layers render together in one sheet. Then I'll regenerate the workbook.

- Implemented automatic overlay: the script now creates a worksheet named "Overlay (Auto)" that combines the first worksheet from each layer into a single view.
- It merges per-layer view datasources, datasource-dependencies, filters, and panes, rewriting datasource references via the existing name mapping so everything renders together.
- Regenerated `merge_project/merged_layers.twb`.

Open the workbook and look for the `Overlay (Auto)` sheet. If you want a different base sheet or specific panes/layers included/excluded, tell me and I’ll adjust the logic.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing schema errors**

I need to address some schema errors related to implementing an overlay. The user wants to create an overlay by appending panes under the view node, but it looks like Tableau expects the <panes> element as a child of <table>, not <view>. Upon checking the earlier structure, I noticed that <panes> should likely sit under <table>, not <view>. It seems I need to ensure that the <view> element is followed correctly by other elements like <style> and <panes>.
**Updating overlay structure**

The content model shows that the <view> element permits only certain children like datasources and filters, while <panes> should actually be placed under <table>, not <view>. I mistakenly appended <panes> under <view>, which doesn't match the schema. Also, it looks like we might have duplicate worksheet names because each overlay was added without removing the existing one. To fix things, I'll update the script to create overlays correctly by placing <panes> under <table> and ensuring everything follows the right sequence.
**Adjusting pane appending logic**

It looks like the error indicates that <panes> should actually be outside of <view> and instead be a child of <table>. Previously, I found <panes> within a <table> in earlier snippets. So, I need to adjust my approach: when appending <panes>, I should locate the parent <table> and append them there instead of under <view>. I'll change the earlier function to find the correct <table> before appending <panes>, ensuring the structure complies with the content model.
**Refining pane handling**

Next, I need to locate the source table and its panes to copy correctly. I also want to make sure we don't create multiple <panes> siblings. If the overlay_table already has <panes>, I should append additional <pane> children instead of creating a new <panes> element. We need to ensure the correct order of elements, with <style> appearing before <panes>. Even though previous errors indicated issues with <panes>, I think aligning the structure properly after <style> should resolve those issues.
**Correcting panes and worksheets**

I need to remove any incorrectly added <panes> under <view> and fix potential duplicate worksheets. Before appending the overlay, I'll check if a worksheet named "Overlay (Auto)" exists; if it does, I'll either replace its content or remove it first. Since <panes> shouldn't be under <view>, I’ll adjust the functions to ensure that I only append them at the <table> level. I also need to handle the unique constraints for worksheets and ensure we append <datasource-dependencies> before <filter> to maintain the correct order. Time to implement these changes!</details></think>

Unable to complete action
Errors occurred while trying to load the workbook "C:\Users\ratth\Downloads\LithiumValley\merge_project\merged_layers.twb". The load was not able to complete successfully.
Error Code: D2E8DA72
Error(108635,18): element 'datasource-dependencies' is not allowed for content model '(datasources?,mapsources?,datasource-dependencies*,filter,sort,perspectives,slices?,aggregation)' (id: C:\Users\ratth\Downloads\LithiumValley\merge_project\merged_layers.twb)
Error(109009,66): element 'worksheets' declares duplicate identity constraint unique values (id: C:\Users\ratth\Downloads\LithiumValley\merge_project\merged_layers.twb)

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing structure issues**

I need to resolve the structure issues in the overlay worksheet. The error message suggests that 'datasource-dependencies' isn't allowed in the specified content model. I see there's a contradiction since 'datasource-dependencies*' seems permitted. My guess is that the order matters: 'datasource-dependencies' should be before any filters, and if 'mapsources' are present, they must come first. I believe our current code may be placing them incorrectly, possibly after slices or aggregation, which is causing the error. I'll double-check the ordering!
**Ensuring correct child ordering**

I need to make sure that the ordering of the view children follows the defined sequence for compliance. The order must be: datasources, mapsources, datasource-dependencies, filters, sort, perspectives, slices, and aggregation. It looks like the current code may be inserting 'datasource-dependencies' in the wrong place, possibly after slices or aggregation. 

To fix this, I think we should create a function that places elements in the correct order, ensuring that dependencies come before filters and sort/perspectives whenever needed.
**Implementing insert function**

I'm planning to implement the `insert_in_view_order(elem)` function. This will involve finding the index for the first occurrence of tags like 'filter', 'sort', 'perspectives', 'slices', or 'aggregation' to insert my element before it; otherwise, I'll append it to the end. 

Also, I need to tackle the duplicate worksheet name issue. While removing existing overlays is good, duplicates can still happen during layer merges if they share names. The error indicates there's a constraint for unique values, suggesting that two worksheets have the same name attribute. I'll ensure that when naming conflicts arise, I append a suffix to maintain uniqueness.
**Addressing duplicate identity constraints**

I’m considering that the duplicate identity constraint might be linked to 'name' attributes within other elements, like worksheets. The error message suggests there's a unique constraint related to certain attribute combinations. It could be that duplicate 'simple-id' nodes are causing issues since worksheets require unique 'simple-id' identifiers across the workbook. When merging copies, I should remove any 'simple-id' children from the copied worksheets to avoid duplication.

Additionally, I’ll improve the insertion logic for 'datasource-dependencies' to ensure proper ordering. I'll implement a utility function to calculate the right position for inserting elements into the view, ensuring they go after 'datasources' and 'mapsources' but before any of the specified tags.
**Updating merge functions and cleanup**

I need to update the `merge_view_datasource_dependencies` function to always use the new insertion logic. When merging filters, I should append them after datasource dependencies but before any sort or perspectives—though appending at the end should still be fine.

Next, I'll implement `remove_simple_ids(worksheet_elem)` to eliminate 'simple-id' under worksheet elements and potentially other nodes, since duplicate constraints on 'worksheets' suggest that's where the issue lies. 

I’ll add this removal process to both `merge_worksheets` and `create_overlay_worksheet` for the worksheet copies. After making these edits, I should run lints and rerun the script. I’ll also check if previous warnings concerning Inclusion/Exclusion groups were addressed. Let's proceed with these changes!</details></think>

I need to address a NameError related to the function merge_worksheets. It seems this function was defined earlier, but maybe it got edited out or replaced incorrectly during modifications, leading to the error. The edit_file tool uses placeholders that aren't recognized in the code. Previous checks were fine, but now it seems like merge_worksheets isn't defined, which suggests it may have been removed. I should open the file to inspect what went wrong.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking code structure**

I'm considering whether the helper function is defined before the main function. The error suggests that when I call it, the name isn't recognized, which could mean the function is placed inside a different section that was overshadowed by edits. I think it would be wise to re-open the file and review the layout. We added a rewrite function near "other helpers," but it's possible that it's positioned incorrectly. I need to confirm the function's placement in the global namespace. Let's check the full file again.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting function visibility**

I'm facing an issue where I still can't see the function after my latest read. I'm wondering if our addition didn't persist or got overwritten somehow. I’ll search for "def rewrite_datasource_references_in_attributes(" in the file again since our earlier grep didn’t show any matches. Even after adding it and passing the read_lints, the NameError keeps appearing. So, I need to do another read of the file to confirm that the function exists; a new grep might also help.</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing the code structure**

I need to properly structure the code by opening the file and adding the helper function right after the imports to ensure it's defined before use. I should use the edit_file tool to do this. Additionally, I'll run lints and the script, aiming for success. 

Previously, we've encountered schema errors regarding 'datasource-dependencies' ordering, so I’ll make sure to handle that. I'm also correcting the placement of 'panes' under the table. Resolving the current NameError is crucial, so I'll add the function again. Let's keep everything aligned with the user's Python setup.
**Planning overlay creation**

I need to ensure that the overlay creation uses the first worksheet of the master file. It’s possible that the base worksheet doesn't have a view or table, though it seems it did before. First, I’ll re-add the function and run it using functions.edit_file and run_terminal_cmd, while making sure to provide status updates before each tool call, per the developer instructions.

I’ll also check if the NameError still exists, due to missing function definitions. My plan is to insert the rewrite function right after the imports, run lints, execute the script, and if successful, prompt the user to open the workbook. That said, earlier schema errors related to 'datasource-dependencies' might still be an issue.</details></think>

Re-adding the missing helper function and re-running the merge to generate a schema-valid overlay sheet.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating overlay sheet structure**

I need to fix the overlay sheet structure. The content model requires each worksheet to contain layout options, a table, and a simple ID in that specific order. During overlay creation, I removed the simple ID to avoid duplicates, but it turns out the worksheet expects one. There are errors indicating missing elements, likely due to this removal. I think I need to generate a new unique simple ID for each copied worksheet instead.
**Implementing unique simple IDs**

I want to implement a function called `ensure_simple_id_unique(worksheet_elem)` that either adds or replaces the simple ID with a new UUID. For overlays, we need to ensure a new UUID is present. Instead of removing simple IDs from layer worksheets, I'll replace them. The ordering should be `<worksheet><table>...` after optional elements and followed by the simple ID. I'll maintain the existing structure while making sure that each worksheet has a unique simple ID located correctly after the table. This means, I’ll replace calls to `remove_simple_ids(ws_copy)` with `set_unique_simple_id(ws_copy)`.
**Implementing unique simple ID insertion**

In the overlay, I need to set a unique simple ID for `base_ws_copy` instead of removing it. I also want to address the earlier error regarding the content model order for view children. To do this, I'll create a function called `insert_simple_id_in_order`. The plan is to remove existing simple IDs, create new ones, and insert them after the table node. This will align with the expected order: "table, simple ID." 

I need to edit the necessary code accordingly and ensure there aren't duplicate overlays. After making changes, I'll run the script again and also check that panes aren't incorrectly placed under view. Additionally, I want to ensure I'm generating new unique UUIDs to satisfy any identity constraints.</details></think>

- Implemented automatic overlay creation in `scripts/merge_tableau_layers.py` that combines the first sheet from each layer into one `Overlay (Auto)` worksheet.
- Fixed schema violations:
  - Inserted `panes` under `table`, not `view`.
  - Enforced ordering for `datasource-dependencies` and `filter` nodes within `view`.
  - Merged missing `column`, `group`, and `metadata-records` in datasources.
  - Ensured each worksheet has a `simple-id` immediately after its `table`, generating a new UUID to satisfy unique constraints.
- Regenerated `merge_project/merged_layers.twb`.

Open the workbook and use the `Overlay (Auto)` sheet. If you prefer a different base sheet or specific layers/panes to include, tell me and I’ll refine the overlay logic.
