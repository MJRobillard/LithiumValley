# Tableau Notebook Development Workflow

This workflow should be followed **for every new Tableau analysis or project**. It provides a structured path from initial idea to a robust, reusable notebook.

---

## Workflow Plan
Given any new data source: 
1. **Proof of Concept Notebook**
    - Start with a quick, exploratory Tableau notebook.
    - Focus on testing new ideas, basic data connections, and rapid visualizations.
    - The goal is to answer: *Is this approach viable?*

2. **Standalone Notebook**
    - Take the working concept and turn it into a clean, self-contained Tableau notebook.
    - Remove test clutter, use cleaned data sources, and document your steps.
    - Ensure others can open and understand the notebook without extra setup.

3. **Dynamic Notebook**
    - Add dynamic elements: parameters, calculated fields, filters, or user controls.
    - Make the workbook interactive and flexible for deeper exploration.
    - Document how the dynamic features work.

4. **Merged Notebook**
    - Integrate this analysis with other relevant Tableau notebooks or dashboards.
    - Resolve any conflicts in structure or data sources.
    - Create a single, polished, comprehensive workbook or dashboard for sharing or presentation.
